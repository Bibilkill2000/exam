Hi, 
would you like to come to my house on 
Saturday evening at 7 pm?
By the way I also got the new computer set up today,
so we can finally play together!

Are you excited for the soon halloween, 
I consider about buying some scary outfit to make fun of classmates. I already imagine their facesðŸ˜‚.

I'm sending this message earlier because 
I know that you rarely getting online.

If you need some help with homework,
just text me and when you
get to me we will look on it,
when you will come to my place.

text me when you'll be free

have a nice day
Arthur
